# <horiseon-accessibility-recode>

## Description


- the the Progect lead requested another pass at the code for our client 'Horiseon'. while the code did run it was verbose and antiquated and I wanted to stream line the code.
- first I converted the the dev layout to semantic and undated the nessary selectors with the new elements. I then noticed repeating and out of order code. I then condenced and rearanged code for a more logical approach.
- I also noticed that the clients name waw left out of the title, and that the images didn't have alternative descriptions.
- through this iI learned how to quickly identify css selectors and their corisponding element even when generic dev elements are the primary element.
